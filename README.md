# WPL-Blind-Clock
Poker Blind Clock

This was a simple, yet useful, tool built to fit one specific purpose.  Fun!  After years of playing poker tournaments with friends, one year we met at a location that had an all-in-one computer next to where we were playing poker.  One evening I developed this blind timer to run on that all-in-one so we wouldn't have to argue who would keep track of the time.  It is a simple program, but designed to aid us in having fun with friends!
